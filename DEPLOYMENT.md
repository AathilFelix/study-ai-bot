# Render Deployment Guide

This project is ready for deployment on Render. Follow these steps:

## Quick Deploy to Render

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Prepare for Render deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Render:**
   - Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
   - Sign up/Login with your GitHub account
   - Click "New +" → "Web Service"
   - Connect your GitHub repository

3. **Configure the Service:**
   - **Name:** `study-ai-bot` (or your preferred name)
   - **Environment:** `Python 3`
   - **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command:** `gunicorn app:app`
   - **Instance Type:** `Free` (for testing) or `Starter` (for production)

4. **Environment Variables:**
   Render will automatically generate a `SECRET_KEY` for you. No manual setup needed!

5. **Deploy:**
   - Click "Create Web Service"
   - Wait for the build to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)
   - Your app will be available at `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

## Files Added for Deployment

- `render.yaml` - Render service configuration
- `Procfile` - Process specification
- `runtime.txt` - Python version specification
- Updated `.gitignore` - Comprehensive ignore rules
- Updated `app.py` - Production-ready configuration

## Important Notes

1. **File Uploads:** On Render's free tier, uploaded files are temporary and will be lost when the service restarts. For persistent file storage, consider upgrading to a paid plan with disk storage or use cloud storage services.

2. **Environment Variables:** The app uses environment variables for configuration in production:
   - `SECRET_KEY` - Automatically generated by Render
   - `PORT` - Automatically set by Render

3. **Performance:** The free tier has some limitations:
   - Services spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity
   - 750 hours/month limit
   - Slower cold starts

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:

1. Check the build logs in Render dashboard
2. Ensure all dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
3. Verify Python version compatibility
4. Check for any hardcoded file paths

## Manual Deployment Steps

If you prefer manual configuration over the `render.yaml` file:

1. In Render dashboard, go to "New +" → "Web Service"
2. Choose "Build and deploy from a Git repository"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Use these settings:
   - **Name:** study-ai-bot
   - **Environment:** Python 3
   - **Build Command:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command:** `gunicorn app:app`
   - **Auto-Deploy:** Yes

Your Study AI Bot will be live and ready to help students learn!
